MyOS is a pet project I started to teach myself more about operating systems.
Feel free to fork this project and try stuff yourself.

Compile MyOS (dependencies)
---
nasm  
qemu  
gcc  
link  

Compile MyOS (requirements)
---
This is currently only compiling on Linux, but I do have plans to make it work in Windows.  
Clone the repository and create a new folder in it called "Bin".  
run "./compile.sh" to compile.  
This script will open qemu and start MyOS automatically.
